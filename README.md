# [WIP] Learning-Assistant
Using ChatGPT to simplify learning new concepts. With a graph implemented in PyGame, you can explore similar ideas and learn new things that are adjacent to the things you already know.   
  
# Usage  
Main script for exploring similar ideas and testing prompts:  
`python -m main.py`  
Game for building graphs (very WIP)  
`python -m LearnAssist.game`    
# TODO:  
- Ability to delete nodes
- Ability to expand nodes with the actual Learning Assistant prompt  
- Some ability to zoom when there's lots of nodes present
